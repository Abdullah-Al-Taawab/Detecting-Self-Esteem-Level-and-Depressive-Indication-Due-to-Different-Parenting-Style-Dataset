Now at the age of 24, I still struggle with taking an initiative to properly lose weight because they bug me about it on a daily basis. Losing weight, now, feels like something I have to do for them rather than for myself. I feel like they have awoken some sort of rigid rebellion inside of me that makes me feel like I am taking revenge on them just by not losing weight for all the pain they caused me. I need therapy for that.....","My parents are strict and rarely emotionally supportive, but they support by providing extra help and resources. I had a home tutor from a very early age and my mother would always organize all my studies for me. That did help me get good grades when I was in school.
