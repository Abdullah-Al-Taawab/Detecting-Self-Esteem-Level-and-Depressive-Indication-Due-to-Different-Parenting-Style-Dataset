# Detecting-Self-Esteem-Level-and-Depressive-Indication-Due-to-Different-Parenting-Style-Dataset
The repository contains 4 datasets of 500 responses. The dataset was collected through a survey. To identify parenting styles, our survey question was influenced by the Parental Authority Questionnaire (PAQ). DASS21 and DASS42 were used as models for the Depression Indication Detection questions. Furthermore, by getting motivated by Rosenbergâ€™s Self Esteem Scale, the questions of self-esteem were created.
In the parenting style dataset labeling was done as 
Authoritarian-0, 
Authoritative-1,
Permissive-2,
Uninvolved-3.
Other Datasets are labeled as  Depressive -1 and non-depressive-0. Again for self-esteem, High-Self esteem as 0 and Low-Self esteem 1.
