12/30/2021 8:49,Male,Dhaka,"Depends on what you define as good qualities. The question is so vague, in fact all the questions are vague. Do the eng101 and eng102 courses again and learn to ask proper questions. If you think being able to socialize with a bunch of idiots known as 'friends' is a good quality, you had a bad upbringing. Friends are just a small part of our lives. We will spend most of our lives interacting with people in our workspace, people within our genuine family, people we need to network with for favors, etc. Our parents know this, they have been through it themselves. So if they say being around with your so-called friends and doing 'kamla' activities and going into pointless gossips in the name of socializing and making memories is wrong, they seriously have a point. Talk to your parents, ask questions. If you can judge your parents decisions, why can't you communicate? Spend more time with family instead of friends and you'll know how to interact with them.","Parents know that the respect of their kids is as important as their respect. They won't let you marry someone from a family without ethics because they know it's bringing trouble from both the family they are getting you married to and their own family because of the criticisms. Parents are considerate on things that aren't possible problems. If parents aren't considerate in allowing you to hang out with your friends who themselves aren't well-mannered, they're right. You might become like them if you hang out with them and so what you define as respect may really be worthless.","I don't compare myself with most other people and other people don't influence me. You're the kind that thinks being able to be like other people, regardless of them being right or wrong, if the proper way. That's not true. Why? Because it's Bangladesh. And it's not Japan. My parents did well not letting me hang out with idiots. My friends also didn't let me hang out with the people who smoke and drink and do drugs so I can say I have a few good friends too.

I do realize that my physical structure is limited for many difficult physical activities. other than that, I think I am capable of doing almost everything that humans can do.","Definitely. I am working hard for the person I want to become. I realized that to become a specialist of my desired field I have to make certain sacrifices as man can not be perfect from all sides due to our limitations.

My parents dont let me for hanging out with my friends. Even in my semester break when all my friends do whatever they like, i have to still stay in my home and my mom used to yell at me for silly things. I can't go for shopping, for outing with my friends or can't dress up like my wish.","Yes,I feel confident that I'm heading in the right direction to be the person I want to be. My parents don't support me for becoming the person i wanna be.  ",1
2/12/2022 10:57,Male,Dhaka,"Yes and no. 

Kind of like, if I am willing to get better and I even worked hard too but their criticism made me feel less of me and frustrated , then yes. 

But eventually, you start using it as an excuse. I did it for some time as well. And stopped pushing myself and be better where I actually could. 

","Definitely yes. When a child is brought up, if parents are considerate of his/her feeling/decision/opinion, the child understand the weight of his words and tries to be better to contribute more. He/she also feel positive about him/her. Thats really crucial as it becomes the very foundation of self esteem. 

If I was appreciated more, not criticized badly for my shortcomings, I would be able to love, respect and care for myself more. And if my parents didn't become considerate of my opinion from college, I would be in a very bad state. Thankfully, I recovered. ","No, not like other people. Don't take it as arrogance, but I believe I am different. I dont do things the same. Some I do worse than others, some better. 

Lets start off with the bad, I kind of had a low self esteem, not strong enough to take criticism (because I have been hurt before) and a bit bitter that, I missed so many things that no point in trying new things now. I even had a hard time getting along with people. I always felt a bit out of place. Moat people do simple things like, riding a bicycle or try to enjoy whenever they can. But because of the pressuring environment I grew up in, I keep asking myself what should I do rather than what I want to do.

But I am working bout it now and Alhamdulillah recovered. 

And the good things.... I am more responsible, honest, hardworking, kind, patient & initiating than others. My father taught me the importance of responsibility, hard work & taking initiative. Not by his words, but by his action. How he took care of our family and the sacrifices he made. My mother taught me how to be patient under crisis, kind when being mistreated and to live an honest life as a good man, more importantly than a successful one. I am better at these things, thanks to my parents. ","My parents are not perfect. They have not always made the right decision. 

If I talk bout the things what could they do better.... Yes, I can make a big list...

But the truth is... As I am growing up... I realize, at least in my case, they had their best intention in the mind. My father had a messy academic career because of politics and the wrong company. Hence, his academic result became a drawback for his dream job. That fear.... Caged him. And unfortunately, I was affected by it and he pressured me to be excellent in academics, not mix up with friend too much. True, he could have done better. 

But..... My parents have done a lot for me as well. So many things to be grateful for. To this very day, if something special is cooked in our house, my father make sure I taste it first. He even enjoys the scenery of me eating. 

When I started noticing that, I stopped becoming bitter and really taught myself to understand them. And I realized they are just hurt people, exhausted & broken by the pressure of reality. So, I started communicating, tried to know them as a person, what made them like this. And Understand how to create a good relation. Cause, after all, they are my biggest blessing from Allah. They have done a lot. I have to be patient with them. 

Ultimately, they now understand me as well. They encourage me do things now. My mother tells me to be a good man, thats all. My father wants me to become an entrepreneur. So Yeah, Alhamdulillah. Although there are diverse problems still, Things seem good now. ",1
2/12/2022 15:54,Male,Khulna,"No. If there is any lacking, it is because of me.",My parents were never inconsiderate. Also they are not 100% perfect.
